by this function)â€“if NULL, the default, this function will start fresh.}

\details{
This function attempts to lookup users information for as many as
90,000 users every 15 minutes, sleeping between calls until Twitter's API
rate limit resets.

It's worth noting that information on many users will not be returned due
to changed screen names, account suspensions, deactivations, etc.
